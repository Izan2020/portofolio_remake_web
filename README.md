# Portoflio Website

This GitHub repository is a comprehensive collection of the source code, design assets, and documentation for my personal portfolio website. The website was meticulously crafted by utilizing a combination of HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap 5.3, resulting in a visually stunning and highly functional online showcase of your skills and accomplishments. To ensure a seamless and aesthetically pleasing user experience, the design process was facilitated using Figma, an industry-standard design tool known for its versatility and collaborative features.

By exploring this repository, you gain access to the core components that bring your portfolio website to life. The HTML files serve as the foundation, defining the structure and content of each page. CSS files, including the main style.css and the essential Bootstrap 5.3 framework (bootstrap.min.css), are responsible for the visual aspects, such as layout, colors, typography, and responsiveness. If you have incorporated any interactive elements or custom functionalities, the repository also provides a dedicated directory for JavaScript files (js/) that power these dynamic features.
